Hello, world,

We have many things to motivate us but from where does motivation starts?
What motivates us? This is a question that everybody asks oneself or another person. We always look at another person and think yes he/she can be my motivation or a video or anything else. Isn't the motivation to start from ourselves? Motivation to keep ourselves motivated.

The willingness to do something starts from our end first then it reaches the other.
<br><br>

### Desires
We all have wishes. There can be any kind of wish like, innocent, weird, sweet, truthful, and a lot more. There are countless desires that a person would love to fulfill. Like, to help others, to make your expenses, or not to depend on anyone else. Each person has a desire or something that they are not able to do at present but would love to fulfill one day. After all, we are all searching for meanings in our lives and these desires give us meaning. The things we love, things we want, things we want to spend our time on, people we love, making others happy it can be anything.
<br>

### Plans
Plans are stepping stones for our dreams. As we have chapters in a book to cover the whole story, we have plans. Accomplishing these small wins is what keeps us going on. These small plans are like small goals that lead us to a bigger goal. It is once said - 
<br> "*Plans are what leads us to a Journey, After all, it is a journey that is much more beautiful*". 
<br> Plans make us keep believing in ourselves. Taking small steps towards our Dreams and fulfill them is what encourages us, to plan more plans and work towards them. Traveling to a small place is a step towards a world tour. Reading the first page of a book leads you to go on a new adventure. Adventures are what keeps our lives exciting. We live for these small moments that become part of a lifetime.

### Small Treats
"*Make Big changes by taking little steps*"  <br>
I went through a talk by Marty Lobdell. He said, "*Treating oneself for small accomplishments leads you to greater achievements*". Always treat yourself with small accomplishments like a song after a chapter, chocolate after practice, or anything that you love. This keeps you going on working on your goals without losing interest in them. After all, it's all about happiness either short or many numbers of shorts.

### Dreams
Always follow your heart that's where all the Dreams lie. We are the best versions of ourselves if we follow what we want. Dreams are what keep us going on when we are awake. They help us to make choices in our endeavors. We make decisions in our life keeping our goals in mind and this what helps us take a risk. Many obstacles or diversions may occur but after all, it is said by Rober Frost.

*Two roads diverged in a wood, <br>
and Iâ€” I took the one less traveled by, <br> 
And that has made all the difference.* <br>

Dreams are what keeps us alive. Always fetch your chance and work for it. Dreams never let us leave what we are pursuing, keeps us believing in what we want, and pursue them.
<br><br>

"*We are such stuff as dreams are made on*" - William Shakespeare

Keep following your dreams and be Happy :)
