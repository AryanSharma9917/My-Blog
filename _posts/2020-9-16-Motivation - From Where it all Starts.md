Hello, world,

We have many things to motivate us but from where does motivation starts?

What motivates us? this is a question that everybody asks oneself or another person. We always look at another person and think yes he/she can be my motivation. But doesn't the motivation start from ourselves? motivation to keep ourselves motivated. We try to keep ourselves motivated so we can achieve what we aim for and fulfill our dreams.

### Small Treats
People like treating themselves. I went through a talk by Marty Lobdell. He stated that keep treating yourself for small accomplishments which will lead you to greater achievements. Like, give yourself a small treat after reading each chapter. Treat yourself a break with a song, chocolate, or anything that you like. This will make things interesting and will push you to work for it. After all, it's all about happiness either short or long.

### Dreams
Always follow your heart that's where all the Dreams lie. We are the best versions of ourselves if we follow what we want. Dreams are what keep us going on when we are awake. They help us to make choices in our endeavors. We make decisions in our life keeping our goals in mind and this what helps us takes a risk. Some many obstacles or diversions may occur but after all, it is said by Rober Frost.

Two roads diverged in a wood, 
and Iâ€” I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference.

Dreams are what keeps us alive. Always fetch your chance and work for it. Dreams never let us leave what we are pursuing, keeps us believing in what we want, and pursue them.

### Plans
Plans are stepping stones for our dreams. as we have chapters in a book to cover the whole story we have plans. Accomplishing these small wins is what keeps us going on. These small plans are like small goals that lead us to a bigger goal. It is once said - Plans are what leads us to a Journey. After all, it is a journey that is much more beautiful. Plans are what makes us believe yes we are taking steps towards our Dreams and we feel ourselves closer to them which encourages us to plan more plans and work towards them. Traveling to a small place is a step towards a world tour. Reading the first page of a book leads you to go on a new adventure. Adventures are what keeps our lives exciting. We live for these small moments that become part of a lifetime:)

### Desires
We all have a desire to help others, to make your expenses, or not to depend on anyone else. There are countless desires that a person would love to fulfill. each person has a desire or something that they are not able to do at present but would love to fulfill that one day. After all, we are all searching for meanings in our lives and these desires give us meaning. The things we love, things we want, things we want to spend our time on, people we love, making others happy it can be anything.
