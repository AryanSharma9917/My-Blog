Hello world,

We have many things to motivate us but from where motivations start

What motivates me?
this is a question that everybody asks oneself or other person. We always look upon other person and think yes he/she can be my motivation. But doesn't the motivation start from ourselves? motivation to keep ourselves motivated. We try to keep ourselves motivated so we can achieve what we aim for and fulfil our dreams.

### Small Treats
People like treating themselves. I went trough a talk by Marty Lobdell. He stated that keep treating yourself for small accomplishments which will lead you to greater achievements. Our life revolves around various things Our life revolves around our duties. We need to fulfil our duties towards different roles of life that we play. The role of a daughter, son, parent, employee, colleague. We have various roles to play but to fulfill those roles with enthusiasm and energy we need to keep treating ourselves. Everytime we help anyone, we fulfil our benchmark. this is the secret of deep happiness.

### Dreams
Dreams are what keep us going on when we are awake. They helps us to make choices in our endeavours.We make decisions in our lifee keeping our goals in mind and this where we wanna be. Dreams are what leads us like a shooting star, always there in our concious and continuously working to reach there. Dreams never let us leave what we are pursuinng keeps us believing in what we want and pursue them.

### Plans
Plans are stepping stones for our dreams. as we have chapters in a book to cover whole story we have plans. Accomplishing these small wins are what keeps us going on. These small plans are like small goals which leads us to bigger goal. It is once said - Plans are what leads us to a Journey. Afterall it is journey that is much more beautiful. Plans are what makes us believe yes we are taking steps towards our Dreams and we feel ourselves more closer to them which encourages us to plan more plans and work towards them. Travelling to a small place is a step towars world tour. Reading first page of a book leads you to go on a new adventure. Adventures are what keeps our lifes exciting. We live for these small moments that becomes part of a lifetime:)

### Desires
We all have desire to help others, to make your own expenses or not to depend on anyone else. There are countless desires that a person would love to fulfil. each person has a desire or something that they are not able to do at present but would love to fulfil that one day. Afterall we are all searching for meanings in our lives and these desires gives us meaning. The things we love, things we want, things we want to spend our time on, people we love, making others happy it can be anything.
