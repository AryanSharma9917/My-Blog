Hello world,

We have many things to motivate us but from where motivations start

What motivates me?
this is a question that everybody asks oneself or other person. We always look upon other person and think yes he/she can be my motivation. But doesn't the motivation start from ourselves? motivation to keep ourselves motivated. We want to keep ourselves motivated so we can achieve what we aim for and fulfil our dreams.

Small Treats
What are the motivations different people have?People like treating themselves. I went trough a talk by Marty Lobdell. He stated that keep treating yourself for small accomplishments which will lead you to greater achievements. Our life revolves around our duties. We need to fulfil our duties towards different roles of life that we play. The role ofa daughter, son, parent, employee, colleague. We have various roles to play but to fulfill those roles with enthusiasm and all the energy we need to keep treating ourselves, Everytime we help anyone, we we fulfil our benchmark. this is the secret of deep happiness.
Dreams
Some people keep themselves motivated by dreams they wanna fulfil. 

Plans
Some wanna fulfil some particular plans 

Desires
Independence - to help other, to make your own expenses, not to depend on anyone else
