title: My GSOC Experience!
---

Hey Guys,

I am not a GSOC person but I will surely like to share my experience with you.

I tried in GSOC for two consecutive years. The experience that we gain from GSOC is really priceless. If we keep on thinking on thinking that as it won't happen I should not do this but even trying a thing that you feel is difficult gives you a lot of satisfaction. That satistaction is what brings you smile.

First year I had no idea what to da and I barely tried anything. I had just gone through projects again and again


Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
