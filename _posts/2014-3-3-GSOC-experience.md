title: My GSOC Experience!
---

Hello people,

This blog is about sharing my GSoC experience with you.

This might be boring but you really would not need to read the whole blog if you read just one para here.

I tried in GSOC for two consecutive years. The experience that we gain from GSOC is really priceless. If we keep on being pessimist like it won't happen, I should not do this, blah! blah! blah! all these are myths believe me trying a little thing with a lot of hard work and keeping in mind that I will get to learn something new is the thing that is priceless. That little smile after accomplishing the task that you thought is impossible is what brings happiness and confidence to face those challenges more and more.

The very First time when I tried for GSoc I was completely unknown to it. I had contributed on Github but the hype og GSoC is what sometimes makes you a little extra nervouus. I didn't submit my proposal for the first time as there was no finalised repo to submit for and being true I didn't even try. I just kept on exploring the repositories in which I can contribute and the time just got over. That's how my first attempt ended. That was kind of foolish but yaa that prepared me for another year of attempt at GSoC.

In my Second attempt I was prepared beforehand. I had gone through repositories, I had selected my project in which I have to contribute that was Nuitka. It was a special project for me. I liked it, it aligned with my skills and found it comfortable to work on. I worked on it, made contribution, its just due to some miss communication everything fall to the wrong side. I know my second attempt ended at wrong page but the knowledge I gained with this experience is really exceptional. I got to learn a new language jinja, learned from my mentor a lot he was really good.

Failure always stinks but I am never able to forget the experience I gained from this and it is truly exceptional!
